# Graphs

The project aims to test the implementation of graphs in the implementation of algorithms for determining MST and shortest paths

## Testing algorithms

---

Tasks performed by the program are saved in the config.ini file in the following syntax

```
<name of file which will contain results>
<name of file with graph> <number of edges which will be loaded> <graph structure> <type of graph> <algorithm> <min graph size> <max graph size> <step> <number of repeats> <type of test>
...

```
In the first line specify name of file which will contain result (CSV file)
In the next lines specify:

- `<name of file with graph>` - name of file where you store graph as a list of edges (eg. source_vertex destination_vertex weight)
- `<number of edges which will be loaded>` - amount of edges you want to load
- `<graph structure>` - adjacency_matrix or adjacency_matrix or incident_matrix (not yet implemented)
- `<type of graph>` - directed or undirected
- `<algorithm>` - MST (Prim) or shortest_paths (Dijkstra)
- `<min graph size>` - minimum graph size which will be tested
- `<max graph size>` - maximum graph size which will be tested
- `<step>` - how fast you want to grow size of graph
- `<number of repeats>` - number of repeats algorithm in test window
- `<type of test>` - time or memory (not yet implemented) or print

For graph generated by combination of vertices I do not recommend conduct tests on one file with different sizes of graph.

## Generating graphs

You can generate graph by setting data-config.ini file and running Python script.

Graph will be generated as a combination od vertices (in the number of edges). Weights of edges will be randomly generated from specified range.

```
[graph]
file_name = <name of file where graph will be saved>
vertices = <number of vertices>
edges = <number of edges>
min_weight = <minimum weight of edge>
max_weight = <maximum weight of edge>
```
